# Changelog for myuw-compact-card

Not yet tracking changes.

**Handling 1.x series special: breaking changes are allowed,**
versioning is basically a niave patch number incrementor.

This means that upstream projects should only seriously depend upon this
component upon a 2.0.0 release or later. :)
